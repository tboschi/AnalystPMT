#configuration file for PulseFinder
#
#debug is 1 for overwriting already analysed files, 0 for only new ones
#verb is verbosity level
#r_hys is the hysteresis ratio with respect to any threshold
#thr_pek is the threshold for pulse definition
#thr_evt is the threshold for event definition
#thr_sig is the threshold for signal discrimination from background
#shape is the time window, for peak and energy computation
#binwid is the time calibration of Data bin width
#graph is 1 for shape analysis, 0 for skipping it (requires some postprocessing resources)
#concurr is -1 for not coincidence average, greater than 0 plot coincidence average
#evlength is the bin size of Data for shape analysis
#peakpos is the position of the peak in the evlength window, in percent
