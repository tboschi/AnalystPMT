#configuration file for PulseFinder
#
#debug with 1 overwrites already analysed files, 0 analyses only the new ones
#verbosity is the verbosity level
#hysratio is the hysteresis ratio with respect to any threshold, 0 for no hysteresis
#thrpeak is the threshold for pulse definition, in mV (?)
#trhevent is the threshold for event definition
#thrsignal is the threshold for signal discrimination from background, in us
#shapingtime is the time window for peak search
#sample is the ratio onf downsampling
#binwidth is the time resolution of the digitiser, in us
#buffer is the total length of the digitiser buffer
#printgraph sets how many graph skips before saving, 0 doesn't save
#printevent sets the threshold in PMT fired for full 2D event plot, -1 don't print
#percent is the position of the peak in the graph window, in percent
#eventlength is the bin size of graph window
#lowbound is the lower bound for the TOF cut
#upbound is the upper bound for the TOF cut
